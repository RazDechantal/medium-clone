# Medium Clone Blog Application

This is a simple blog application inspired by Medium, where users can read posts, write their own posts, and add comments. The application is built using React, React Router, and the Context API for state management.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Clone this repository, navigate into the project directory, and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd medium-clone
npm install
```

## Application Structure

```

- **components/**: Contains reusable React components.
- **context/**: Contains context providers for managing global state.
- **pages/**: Contains the main pages of the application.
- **App.js**: The root component that sets up routing and context providers.
- **App.css**: The main CSS file for styling the application.
- **index.js**: The entry point of the application.

## Code Logic

### Contexts

1. **UserContext.js**: Manages the state of the logged-in user. It provides the current user and a method to update the user state.

2. **BlogContext.js**: Manages the state of blog posts and comments. It provides methods to add, update, and delete posts, as well as add comments to posts.

### Components

1. **BlogPost.js**: Displays a single blog post along with the ability to edit or delete the post if the logged-in user is the author. It also includes functionality to add comments to the post.

2. **BlogPostList.js**: Displays a list of blog posts. It uses the BlogContext to fetch the list of posts and renders a BlogPost component for each post.

3. **Comment.js**: Displays a single comment. It shows the username of the commenter and the comment text.

4. **CommentList.js**: Displays a list of comments for a blog post. It uses the Comment component to render each comment.

### Pages

1. **HomePage.js**: The home page that displays all blog posts and allows the user to add a new post. It uses the BlogPostList component to display the posts and includes a form to add a new post.

2. **MyPostsPage.js**: A page that displays only the logged-in user's posts, allowing them to edit or delete their posts. It filters the posts from the BlogContext to show only the posts authored by the logged-in user.

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Testing the Application

1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Open the application in your browser.
   - Navigate to the homepage and ensure you see the list of posts.
   - Try adding a new post and verify it appears in the list.
   - Navigate to the "My Posts" page and ensure you see only the posts written by the logged-in user.
   - Try editing and deleting posts written by the logged-in user.
   - Add comments to posts and ensure they appear correctly.

2. **Automated Testing**:
   - For automated testing, you can use Jest and React Testing Library to write unit tests and integration tests for your components.
   - Install Jest and React Testing Library:
   ```sh
   npm install @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
   ```
   - Create test files in the `src` directory and write tests for each component and page.

For example, here is a simple test for the `HomePage` component:

```jsx
// src/pages/HomePage.test.js
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import { UserProvider } from '../context/UserContext';
import { BlogProvider } from '../context/BlogContext';
import HomePage from './HomePage';

test('renders blog posts', () => {
  render(
    <Router>
      <UserProvider>
        <BlogProvider>
          <HomePage />
        </BlogProvider>
      </UserProvider>
    </Router>
  );

  expect(screen.getByText(/Blog Posts/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Run your tests using:

```sh
npm test
```
